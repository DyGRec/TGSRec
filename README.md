# Introduction 
This is the repository of our accepted CIKM 2021 paper "Continuous-Time Sequential Recommendation with Temporal Graph Collaborative Transformer" and the proposed model is TGSRec. Paper is available on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06625). This work focuses on multi-steps continuous-time recommendation, where user and item embeddings are generated in any unseen future timestamps. Different from existing sequential recommendation methods, which are optimized for next-item prediction, this work is learned for recommendation in any timestamps.
